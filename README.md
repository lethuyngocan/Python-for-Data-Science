## 1) How to do EDA  of large-scale data (several TB scale) using python?
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large-scale data (several terabytes) requires special considerations due to the volume and complexity of the dataset. Python provides libraries like PySpark and Dask that can handle large-scale data efficiently. Here's an outline of how you can approach EDA of large-scale data using Python and PySpark:

1. Set up PySpark and Spark Context:
   - Install PySpark by running `pip install pyspark` in your Python environment.
   - Import the necessary PySpark modules:
     ```python
     from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
     ```

2. Create a Spark Session:
   - Configure the Spark application and create a Spark session:
     ```python
     spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LargeScaleDataEDA").getOrCreate()
     ```

3. Load the Data:
   - Read the large-scale data using Spark's DataFrame API, which provides a tabular data structure and distributed processing capabilities:
     ```python
     data = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('large_data.csv')
     ```

4. Perform Data Exploration and Analysis:
   - Explore the data by applying various operations and transformations on the DataFrame, such as filtering, aggregations, and statistical calculations. Here are some common operations:

     - Summary statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
       ```python
       data.describe().show()
       ```

     - Data profiling: Get an overview of the data's structure, data types, and non-null counts.
       ```python
       data.printSchema()
       data.describe().show()
       ```

     - Data visualization: Generate plots and visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or PySpark's built-in visualization capabilities.

5. Sample Data for Detailed Analysis:
   - Due to the large-scale nature of the data, it may be impractical to analyze the entire dataset. Instead, consider sampling a subset for more detailed analysis. You can use Spark's `sample()` method to select a representative sample based on various sampling strategies (e.g., random sampling, stratified sampling).
     ```python
     sampled_data = data.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)  # Adjust fraction and seed as needed
     ```

6. Further Analysis and Visualization:
   - Apply specific EDA techniques such as correlation analysis, feature engineering, data segmentation, or hypothesis testing on the sampled data.
   - Utilize PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to perform efficient parallel processing on the large-scale data.

Remember to adjust the file paths, data loading options, and the specific EDA techniques based on your dataset and analysis goals.

PySpark's distributed computing framework allows you to handle large-scale data efficiently by distributing the processing across a cluster of machines. This way, you can perform comprehensive EDA on large-scale datasets that may not fit into memory.

Note that the exact steps and techniques may vary depending on your specific dataset, available resources, and analysis requirements. Additionally, consider optimizing Spark's cluster settings, such as the number of executors, memory allocation, and parallelism, to achieve the best performance for your particular environment.

## 2) How to processing and sorting of large-scale data up to several TB scale using python
When working with large-scale data on the order of several terabytes (TB) in Python, the traditional approach of loading the entire dataset into memory may not be feasible. In such cases, you can leverage distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark, which seamlessly integrates with Python through the PySpark library. Here's an outline of how you can process and sort large-scale data up to several TB scale using Python and PySpark:

1. Set up PySpark and Spark Context:
   - Install PySpark by running `pip install pyspark` in your Python environment.
   - Import the necessary PySpark modules:
     ```python
     from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext
     ```

2. Create a Spark Context:
   - Configure the Spark application:
     ```python
     conf = SparkConf().setAppName("LargeScaleDataProcessing")
     sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
     ```

3. Load and Process the Data:
   - Read the large-scale data using Spark's RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset):
     ```python
     data = sc.textFile('large_data.txt')  # Replace with the path to your large-scale data file
     ```

   - Process the data by applying transformations on the RDD, such as filtering, mapping, or aggregating operations. For example, to filter rows based on a condition:
     ```python
     filtered_data = data.filter(lambda row: condition(row))
     ```

4. Sort the Data:
   - Use the `sortBy()` or `sortByKey()` function on the RDD to sort the data. This operation can be memory-intensive, but Spark efficiently handles large-scale sorting through its distributed processing capabilities. For example, to sort the data in ascending order:
     ```python
     sorted_data = filtered_data.sortBy(lambda row: sort_key(row), ascending=True)
     ```

5. Save the Sorted Data:
   - If you want to save the sorted data to a new file, you can use the `saveAsTextFile()` function:
     ```python
     sorted_data.saveAsTextFile('sorted_data.txt')  # Replace with the desired output path
     ```

6. Terminate the Spark Context:
   - Once you have completed the processing, make sure to stop the Spark Context to release the resources:
     ```python
     sc.stop()
     ```

By utilizing PySpark and Spark's distributed computing capabilities, you can efficiently process and sort large-scale data that may not fit into memory. Spark's ability to distribute the computation across a cluster of machines allows it to handle datasets on the order of several terabytes or even larger.

Remember to adjust the file paths, data processing operations, and sorting key functions according to your specific dataset and requirements. Additionally, you may need to configure Spark's cluster settings, such as the number of executors, memory allocation, and parallelism, to optimize the performance for your specific environment.
