## 1) How to do EDA  of large-scale data (several TB scale) using python?
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on large-scale data (several terabytes) requires special considerations due to the volume and complexity of the dataset. Python provides libraries like PySpark and Dask that can handle large-scale data efficiently. Here's an outline of how you can approach EDA of large-scale data using Python and PySpark:

1. Set up PySpark and Spark Context:
   - Install PySpark by running `pip install pyspark` in your Python environment.
   - Import the necessary PySpark modules:
     ```python
     from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
     ```

2. Create a Spark Session:
   - Configure the Spark application and create a Spark session:
     ```python
     spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LargeScaleDataEDA").getOrCreate()
     ```

3. Load the Data:
   - Read the large-scale data using Spark's DataFrame API, which provides a tabular data structure and distributed processing capabilities:
     ```python
     data = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('large_data.csv')
     ```

4. Perform Data Exploration and Analysis:
   - Explore the data by applying various operations and transformations on the DataFrame, such as filtering, aggregations, and statistical calculations. Here are some common operations:

     - Summary statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
       ```python
       data.describe().show()
       ```

     - Data profiling: Get an overview of the data's structure, data types, and non-null counts.
       ```python
       data.printSchema()
       data.describe().show()
       ```

     - Data visualization: Generate plots and visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or PySpark's built-in visualization capabilities.

5. Sample Data for Detailed Analysis:
   - Due to the large-scale nature of the data, it may be impractical to analyze the entire dataset. Instead, consider sampling a subset for more detailed analysis. You can use Spark's `sample()` method to select a representative sample based on various sampling strategies (e.g., random sampling, stratified sampling).
     ```python
     sampled_data = data.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)  # Adjust fraction and seed as needed
     ```

6. Further Analysis and Visualization:
   - Apply specific EDA techniques such as correlation analysis, feature engineering, data segmentation, or hypothesis testing on the sampled data.
   - Utilize PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to perform efficient parallel processing on the large-scale data.

Remember to adjust the file paths, data loading options, and the specific EDA techniques based on your dataset and analysis goals.

PySpark's distributed computing framework allows you to handle large-scale data efficiently by distributing the processing across a cluster of machines. This way, you can perform comprehensive EDA on large-scale datasets that may not fit into memory.

Note that the exact steps and techniques may vary depending on your specific dataset, available resources, and analysis requirements. Additionally, consider optimizing Spark's cluster settings, such as the number of executors, memory allocation, and parallelism, to achieve the best performance for your particular environment.
